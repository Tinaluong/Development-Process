## 1 Introduction


The goal of this project is to develop an Android app called TCCart, a payment and rewards management system for the owners Brad and Janet.



## 2 Process Description

Our team is going to use a Rational Unified Process (RUP) to create the following deliverables. We feel like this is the best fit because for this document we are going to be iterating our documents throught each phase.  
# Inception and Elaboration
###Activity #1
| Activity name | Project Plan  |
| --- | --- |
| **Activity description** | In this document we will briefly introduce what product we are creating and what kind of software development life cycle we are going to use in order to complete the development process in a fashion we feel is best for the task at hand.  |
| **Entrance criteria** | For this document we need to have an Introduction, Process Description and list our Team and their roles. In order to complete this document we need to know what the product is we are creating, discuss what workflow works best for designing this product and delegate roles to team members. |
| **Exit criteria** | We will know this document is complete when we feel that we choose the most efficient model for developing this product and everyone on the team feels comfortable with their assigned roles. |

###Activity #2
| Activity name | Vision Document|
| --- | --- |
| **Activity description** | In this document we want to make it so that our clients are clear on what we are planning to do, why and what can’t this product do. We also want to present it in a high-level to them. We want to make it simple enough that they can understand what we are doing and don’t want to use any terminology that would be foreign to them. |
| **Entrance criteria** | For this document we need an introduction, business needs/requirements, product / solution, major features and scope and limitations. In order to accomplish this we need to know the details of what they want the project to accomplish and background about the client’s company.|
| **Exit criteria** | We will know that this document is completed when we feel comfortable that the document produces a high level view of what we are trying to accomplish, conveys why the client needs this product, the limitations of it and that all of it is non-technical. |

###Activity #3
| Activity name | Use Case Model|
| --- | --- |
| **Activity description** | In this document we want to show an outside view of our system. More specifically we want to show the sequence of interactions of outside actors in the system that we are modeling and how the systems actions causes an observable result of value to the actors. In order to complete this document we have to know the purpose of the product the client wants and the functional requirements required. |
| **Entrance criteria** | For this document we need to create a use case diagram and use case descriptions. In order to complete this document we have to know the purpose of the product the client wants and the functional requirements required.  |
| **Exit criteria** | We will know when this document is complete when the team feels that the use cases provide a detailed view of the requirements needed by seeing the scenario of usages, helps define a good system architecture, helps the planning of the development of our system and can help us in testing our system because we can see what the main pieces of the functionality of our system are.|

###Activity #4
| Activity name | Design Document |
| --- | --- |
| **Activity description** | In this document we want to show provide additional information about how to clarify assumptions, constraints and why we designed our product how we did. This document also needs to include UML’s for our architectural design and to show what main methods and attributes need to be created. |
| **Entrance criteria** | The document must include, Design Considerations (Assumptions, Constraints, System Environment), Architectural Design (Component Diagram, Deployment Diagram), Low-level Design (Class Diagram, Other Diagrams), and a User Interface Design. In order to create this we need a detailed requirements document and an idea of what the client wants and a idea of how we want to accomplish these goals. |
| **Exit criteria** | We will know when this is complete when our team feels comfortable that the major assumptions and constraints are represented, the diagrams are designed in a efficient and logical fashion and that we have a good idea of how we want to layout our GUI so that it is clean and intuitive for our client . |

###Activity #5
| Activity name | Test Plan |
| --- | --- |
| **Activity description** | In this document we want to make test cases that our product must satisfy for the requirements that are specified by our client in order to ensure our product as much as possible. The test cases are created from the use case models and will provide which kind of test cases are needed and specifics of how we will implement each test case.  |
| **Entrance criteria** |The document must include, Testing Strategy (Overall Strategy, Test Selection, Adequacy Criterion, Bug Tracking, Technology) and Test Cases. For this document we will need our design document and our use cases in order to make good decisions on how we want to test our product.  |
| **Exit criteria** | We will know that this document is complete when we feel comfortable that our testing strategy is the right choice for our project and that the tests we implement test the correct system functions.|
